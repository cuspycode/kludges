<P>
I originally wrote this script in order to slow down my downloads from
the Internet, a few years back when I only had 0.5 Mbit/s downstream.
Doing downloads in the background was painful because all available
bandwidth was consumed by the download. Using a browser at the same
time felt like going to back to using a dial-up modem. So I wrote a
sort of "netcat" type of program that could insert small time delays
between the packets. I would start by downloading a large file on a
remote server, and then I would use "skyffla.pl" to slowly copy it to my
home machine while reserving some bandwidth for surfing, telnetting, etc.

<P>
Nowadays I don't use the delay option anymore, but I still use the script
quite a lot as a sort of lightweight, customizable "netcat". Especially
on older machines where <CODE><B>scp</B></CODE> is a CPU hog.
