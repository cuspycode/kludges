# kludges

Some selected hacks of mine, from the 1980s and onwards.

Source control history has been maintained where possible. The earliest recorded commits are from the early naughties.

The README.md files are just the original index.html files from earlier hostings of these pieces of code. Most links probably won't work because they have deteriorated.

This repository is a combination of both historical hacks that will never be updated, and newer hacks that might be updated for a while, and then graduate to never-be-updated status (as all software ultimately does). It is also a work in progress in the sense that I will add more archaeological finds as I encounter them.
